AWS:
pillars:-
1. Security --- IAM, traceability,l4,l7,risk assesment and mitigation strategy
2. reliablity -- on demand usage, auto scaling, fail over, no SQl, read replicas, cache mechnaism 
3. Cost optimization -- eliminate unwanted usgae, deploy in same region 
4. performance efficiency --- use right recources , high CPU and RAm
5. operational excellence ---- cloud watch(monitoring)
Data center: 1000's of servers can be stored online. 
1 availabity zone can have mulitple data cernter.
1 AWS region can have multiple availabity zones. there are 18 regions . there are 77 edge locations.
AMI (amazon machine image)
market place
create your own
pre build
ec2- elastic comute cloud
EBS(elastic blockstorage) can be linked to 1 instance at a time. SSD, HDD
EFS (elastic file storge) can be linked to multiple instance for the same storage. defalut 8gb of storage. 
S3- simple storage service 
elastic address
vpc- virtual private cloud 
auto scaling -- min 2 max 12 add early delete late
dc -direct connect (private connectivity btw on premise to cloud)
